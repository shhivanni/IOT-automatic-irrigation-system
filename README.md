# IOT-automatic-irrigation-system
Abstract 

This project presents an Automated Irrigation System based on IoT and embedded systems to ensure efficient water management for agricultural applications. The system uses soil moisture sensors to monitor soil conditions and automatically controls the water pump when irrigation is necessary. The integration of an LCD display provides real-time status updates to the user. The project is built around a microcontroller that processes sensor data and automates the irrigation process based on threshold values. This not only conserves water but also minimizes human intervention, making it highly suitable for small-scale and remote agricultural settings.
